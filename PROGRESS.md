## Phase 0-4: COMPLETED ✅

### What We Built

**Phase 0: Foundation**
- ✅ Complete documentation (8 files)
- ✅ Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Supabase project created and linked

**Phase 1: Database Schema**
- ✅ 4 schemas: staging_ingest, core_warehouse, reporting, app_dashboard
- ✅ 20+ tables with proper constraints and indexes
- ✅ RPC functions for worker operations
- ✅ All migrations applied to remote Supabase

**Phase 2: Edge Function**
- ✅ `/sync` API endpoint as Supabase Edge Function
- ✅ Job enqueue via RPC (bypasses schema restrictions)
- ✅ Request validation and error handling

**Phase 3: Worker Foundation**
- ✅ Job polling with Supabase client (no direct DB connection)
- ✅ Optimistic locking via RPC
- ✅ Platform dispatcher (routes to Shopify, Meta, GA4, Klaviyo)
- ✅ Tested locally and working

**Phase 4: Shopify Integration**
- ✅ Shopify Bulk Operations client
- ✅ Download and parse JSONL orders
- ✅ Insert to staging via RPC
- ✅ Transform to warehouse via RPC
- ✅ **Successfully synced 2,994 real orders** from bohoem58.myshopify.com
- ✅ Incremental sync with cursor management

**Key Architecture Decision:**
- Uses Supabase RPC functions instead of direct PostgreSQL connections
- Avoids IPv4/IPv6 and Railway PG* environment variable issues
- More secure: DB credentials never exposed

---

## Phase 6: Frontend Dashboard (In Progress)

### What We Built

- Shopify dashboard route (`/shopify`) that mirrors Shopify Analytics with:
  - Shared date picker and comparison-ready layout
  - Revenue and orders charts powered by reporting RPC functions
  - Channel performance cards sourced from marketing fact tables
  - Recent orders table hydrated from the `public.orders` view
- Overview landing experience upgraded:
  - `useActiveShop` determines the active shop and currency for all dashboards
  - Dashboard metrics hook coerces RPC payloads into typed, null-safe data structures
  - KPI tiles, charts, and channel cards now stream real data with resilience to partial results
  - Loading states preserve the previous data while refreshes run and surface the last refresh timestamp

### Next Focus

- Extend dashboard to cover Meta, GA4, and Klaviyo views once Phase 5 integrations land
- Add saved filters and comparison mode toggle after multi-platform data is available

## Current Phase: Phase 5 - Marketing Integrations

### Objective

Extract marketing data from Meta Ads, GA4, and Klaviyo to compute MER/ROAS.

### Tasks

Meta Ads Integration:
- [ ] Create Meta Ads client for Marketing API
- [ ] Implement authentication (access token)
- [ ] Fetch daily ad insights (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions)
- [ ] Insert to staging_ingest.meta_ads_raw
- [ ] Transform to core_warehouse.fact_marketing_daily
- [ ] Test with test ad account

GA4 Integration:
- [ ] Create GA4 client for Data API v1
- [ ] Implement authentication (service account JSON)
- [ ] Fetch daily report (sessions, users, revenue, transactions)
- [ ] Insert to staging_ingest.ga4_raw
- [ ] Transform to core_warehouse.fact_ga4_daily
- [ ] Test with test property

Klaviyo Integration:
- [ ] Create Klaviyo client for Metrics API
- [ ] Implement authentication (private API key)
- [ ] Fetch daily metrics (emails sent, opens, clicks, revenue)
- [ ] Insert to staging_ingest.klaviyo_raw
- [ ] Transform to core_warehouse.fact_email_daily
- [ ] Test with test account

Reporting:
- [ ] Create reporting.mer_roas view
- [ ] Verify MER/ROAS calculations with real data

### Blockers

- **Need credentials:**
  - Meta Ads: Ad Account ID + Access Token
  - GA4: Property ID + Service Account JSON
  - Klaviyo: Private API Key
- All three platforms required to compute MER/ROAS

### Next Steps

1. **Get credentials** from user for Meta, GA4, Klaviyo
2. **Start with Meta Ads** (usually easiest to set up)
3. **Then GA4** (requires service account setup)
4. **Then Klaviyo** (straightforward API key)
5. **Build reporting view** once all data sources available

### Estimated Completion

- **Target:** 2025-01-10 (4-5 days)
- **Confidence:** Medium - Three separate API integrations

## Session Log

### Session 1 - 2025-01-04
**Completed:** Documentation foundation (8 files)

### Session 2 - 2025-01-04
**Completed:**
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- packages/config with shared TypeScript types
- Database schema with 4 schemas, 20+ tables
- Supabase migrations applied to remote

### Session 3 - 2025-01-05
**Completed:**
- Edge Function `/sync` with RPC job enqueue
- Worker foundation with Supabase RPC architecture
- Shopify Bulk Operations integration
- **Successfully synced 2,994 orders from Shopify store**
- Refactored to use Supabase RPC (no direct DB connections)
- Railway deployment documentation
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub

**Key Achievement:** End-to-end working pipeline from Shopify → Supabase

**Next Session:** Phase 5 - Marketing Integrations (Meta, GA4, Klaviyo)

### Session 4 - 2025-11-11
**Completed:**
- Added dedicated Shopify dashboard page with live Supabase metrics, charts, channel insights, and recent orders
- Introduced `useActiveShop` hook to share shop resolution and currency across pages
- Refined dashboard metrics hook with typed RPC mapping, numeric coercion, and null-safe handling
- Rebuilt overview dashboard UI: currency-aware KPI tiles, persistent loading states, refreshed charts/tables, and friendlier empty states
- Re-authored dashboard metrics RPC to compute accurate averages and deltas from aggregated totals

**Next Session:** Blocked on marketing credentials; continue Phase 5 integrations while extending frontend coverage once data is available

## Outstanding Questions

- [x] Which Shopify store? **bohoem58.myshopify.com**
- [ ] What Meta Ad Account ID should be used?
- [ ] What GA4 Property ID should be used?
- [ ] What Klaviyo account should be used?
- [ ] What domain for production deployment?
- [ ] Dashboard authentication? (internal tool vs public)
