# Rebuild Progress (Phase 0+)

| Date | Work | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 2025-11-18 | Repo & Supabase hard reset (all legacy code/docs removed, schemas dropped) | ✅ |
| 2025-11-18 | Added `REBUILD_SPEC.md` + `ENV_SPEC.md` as new sources of truth | ✅ |
| 2025-11-19 | Implemented dual-stage Shopify connect flow (seed incremental run + auto historical), dashboard status banners, and sequential sync orchestration | ✅ |

Use this file to track ONLY work performed after the hard reset. Each session should append concise entries referencing the rebuild spec.***
